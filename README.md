# GetBack

 DONE:
   - main.cpp 
   - Game( .h, .cpp): base class structure of the game
   - MainMenu( .h, .cpp): Class for the main menu
   - Some sprites:
        - bg1.png: First scene background
        - caveEntrance.png: Sprite for the entrance to the cave in the first scene
        - p1_N.png: Character 1
   - Close the window when the X is pressed from any window.
   - Make everything happen within a single window(not open and close windows to swap scenes).
   - Center the camera on the player and move him around the map (background).
   - Fix player movement bugs:
        - if 'A' and 'D' are pressed and then 'W' or 'S' get pressed without
        releasing 'A' or 'D', the player should move UP or DOWN(its moving diagonally).
   - Make the player collide with the borders of the window.
   
 TO DO:
   - Add an object(s) to pick up.
   - Add an In-game menu (backpack):
        - Display collected items.
        - Interact with items(long term).
        - Save progress.
        - Exit to the main menu.
   - Design structure to save the progress within the game.
